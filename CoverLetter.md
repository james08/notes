# Cover Letter

Hi, I'm interested in the Java developer position you have posted.

I'm a Pragmatic problem solver. This is where I add value to a team. For example, I believe that changes should not be made unless necessary. I believe that keeping it simple is key to the future of the software.
I enjoy working within a team and thrive on communication.

Here is brief summary of my work experience, touching on the main technologies in each stack.

I'm a Java developer. I started in January 2008 working with a large retail system based on enterprise Java and Postgres, I gained a lot of experience with the command line, bash scripting and SQL. Moving on to my next job in 2012 I worked on an online banking system (the largest in South Africa), Java, JSPs, Servlets, Postgres. Highlights were breaking a monolith up into microservices and building a distributed index for customer notifications. For the last year I've been working in Auckland. The software is based on OSGi microservices. Here I've worked in analytics on medical data using Elasticsearch. I've had the opportunity to lead presentations on our work to the analytics team in the USA. I've also been responsible for onboarding a team of contractors. I'm currently working with data parsing, ingestion and retrieval. We use RESTful services, XML, Hibernate, Oracle/MSSQL backend.

Please find my complete CV included.

Sincerely,

James Kukard
